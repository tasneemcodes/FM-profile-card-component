Frontend Mentor | Profile Card Component by Tasneem

My solution to the [Profile card component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ) on Frontend Mentor. As an extra feature, I added an @keyframes animation where the card transforms up the Y-axis. 

The code is split into 2 parts: 
1. MAIN WRAPPER - to put the card in the middle of the page
2. PROFILE CARD - to hold all the contents within the card which was split into ->
<br>a) BACKGROUND - for the SVG header<br> 
    b) INFORMATION - photo, name, age and location<br>
    c) VIEWS - numbers and descriptions
